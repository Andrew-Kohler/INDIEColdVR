## Scenes
A single scene, *DemoScene*, contains a modified OVRCameraRig that can support remapping (*V1 Remappable OVR Camera Rig*).
The scene contains a control panel for all currently implemented hand shaking techniques, with options to automatically set them to various detection thresholds from prior work.
There are also some objects that can be picked up with the controller by pressing the back trigger button while touching the object.
